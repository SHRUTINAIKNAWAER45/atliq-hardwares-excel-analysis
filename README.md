Financial & Market Performance Analysis – AtliQ Hardwares
1. Problem Statement

AtliQ Hardwares is a global hardware manufacturing company that wanted to understand its business performance from 2019 to 2021. Although revenue was growing rapidly, management did not have a clear view of:

Which markets and customers were driving growth

Whether the company was meeting its sales targets

How profitability and margins were changing over time

The data was available but not organized in a way that supported fast and reliable business decisions.

2. Solution

I built a dynamic Excel-based analytics system using:

Pivot Tables

Slicers & filters

Advanced formulas

Conditional formatting

The solution provides:

Profit & Loss (P&L) reports for 2019, 2020, and 2021

Customer-wise and market-wise sales analysis

Monthly and quarterly performance tracking

Target vs Actual comparison

This allowed decision-makers to instantly filter and analyze performance by region, market, customer, and year.

3. Key Findings

From the analysis:

Net Sales grew from $87.5M in 2019 to $598.9M in 2021, showing 304% growth

Gross Margin increased from $36.2M to $218.2M, indicating strong profit growth

Gross margin % declined, suggesting rising costs

India, USA, UK, and South Korea were the highest revenue-generating markets

Some countries failed to meet 2021 targets, highlighting areas needing strategy improvement

A small group of high-value customers contributed a large share of revenue

4. Business Insights

This analysis helps AtliQ Hardwares to:

Identify high-performing markets and customers

Improve pricing and cost control

Set realistic sales targets

Support budgeting and forecasting

Make data-driven strategic decisions
